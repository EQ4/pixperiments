A script for building your own gnu toolchain for ARM.

This is derived from David Welch's repo at
https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi/tree/master/buildgcc

Which is itself apparently derived directly from the same script at the mpx
project at opencores.org

I have modified it for newlib and better floating point performance.

Change the PREFIX in the script to a path where you want the
binary to end up.

sudo ./build_gcc

then put whatever you had in your prefix/bin in the path.  The default
gnuarm would mean /gnuarm/bin goes in the PATH.
